# Fly-like-a-Butterfly

Remake of the Original Flappy Bird Using JS, CSS & HTML

## Technologies used and approach taken

**Absolute positioning** is used on all movement (flight, gravity) and to detect collision between the butterfly and a spider web.

**setInterval/setTimeout** is used for the gravity effect on the butterfly, the movement of the spider webs (flight of the butterfly) and the generation of new spider webs.
