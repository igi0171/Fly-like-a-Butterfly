# Fly-like-a-Butterfly

Remake of the Original Flappy Bird Using JS, CSS & HTML

## Technologies used

**Absolute positioning** is used on all movement (flight, gravity) and to detect collision between the butterfly and a spider web.

**setInterval/setTimeout** is used for the gravity effect on the butterfly, the movement of the spider webs (flight of the butterfly) and the generation of new spider webs.

## Approach taken

1. Create game container, sky, grass and butterfly CSS.
2. Create butterfly's gravity and fly functions.
3. Create spider webs CSS, functions to generate and move spider webs and condition for removing spider webs.
4. Create butterfly hitting grass and colliding with spider webs condition.
5. Create top spider webs CSS.
6. Refine algorithm for collision detection against top and bottom spider webs.
7. Final overall styling.

## Unsolved problems / Further work / Next steps

- Butterfly is immune againt bottom right edge of top spider web. (Could be lore)
- Sometimes incoming spider web doesn't stop moving even after game is over. (Could be lore too)
- Button to start the game again after game is over instead of reloading page.
- Add best score feature.
- Make the video start playing at 0:11 when the game begins and the player wins when the video reaches 4:48.
